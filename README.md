# The C Programming Language
The C Programming Language (sometimes termed K&R, after its authors' initials) is a computer programming book written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, the latter of whom originally designed and implemented the C programming language, as well as co-designed the Unix operating system with which development of the language was closely intertwined. 

This repository contains my solutions to this bible of C. Each solution was carefully tested. The compiler is clang-14.0.3

If you discoverd some problem or have better solution, issues or PRs are welcome. It will make this repository better.
